	abstract = {Using several themes of corrupting practices, this study attempted to assess the status and corrosive nature of corruption in Ethiopia through the lenses of public officials and other relevant communities of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Survey respondents, inter alia, believe that favoritism and nepotism are ubiquitous, all the key government institutions listed in the survey are corrupt and that the Ethiopian political-economic system is opaque in that politically appointed officials and party leaders are in charge of both state-owned and party-owned conglomerates-the same officials directing government contracts and loans to political party owned conglomerates. The authors of this study believe the respondents' perceptions of the pervasive nature of Ethiopia's corruption have important policy and administrative implications to all stakeholders such as Ethiopian government and its people, donor nations, multinational institutions, international business community and those who are working against the scourge of corruption globally.

	abstract = {As corruption affects people in all walks of life, public reactions to corruption and citizens’ views of the government’s anti-corruption effort are critically important. Any government seeking to make effective policy against corruption must obtain public trust and support, which provides the much-needed legitimacy for policy enforcement. In this study, we drew on a survey of 1,604 randomly selected residents in Shanghai in 2008 to examine the perceptions and attitudes of Chinese citizens towards the government’s anti-corruption effort. Specifically, we focussed on the “sense of anticorruption efficacy,” defined as people’s expectation for positive anti-corruption outcomes. We addressed two questions. To what extent the public was confident in the government’s anti-corruption efficacy? What factors explained the variation in people’s perceptions of anti-corruption efficacy? Results indicated that two salient factors could affect an individual’s sense of anti-corruption efficacy. First, as corruption contributed to social disparity, the perceived unfairness of income distribution exacerbated people’s expectation for anti-corruption efficacy. Secondly, an accepting attitude towards power intrusion into income distribution diluted the positive impact of the perception of unfair distribution on people’s expectation for anti-corruption efficacy. We take from the results that to what extent people expect the government to make effective effort to control corruption is determined by both economic and political factors. People develop high expectation for anti-corruption reform when they are unhappy not only with the lack of fairness in income distribution but also with the intrusion of political power into economic affairs which, if unconstrained, often gives rise to corruption.

	abstract = {{SUMMARY} Many anti-corruption organisations work from the notion that both petty and grand corruption axiomatically results in negative consequences. However, few studies have asked citizens to evaluate the effects of different scales and types of corruption. This article investigates how rural people in Papua New Guinea associate dysfunctional or functional consequences to different types and scales of corruption. It draws on findings from focus groups conducted in four provinces of the country. The article finds that most examples of corruption considered by respondents were perceived as dysfunctional; however, marginalised respondents considered small-scale corruption as functional-if the acts described benefitted marginalised people. These findings suggest that it is critical that anti-corruption organisations understand and respond to the constraints faced by poor and marginalised people when operating in weak states.

	abstract = {Corruption is one of the persistent problems of the societies over the years and it affects the credibility of public institutions and its ambassadors in front of the citizens and of the other related countries. This phenomenon eludes the rules, the transparency and the impersonal and impartial aspect of public actions, but, also, the responsibility for all these irregularities, being the opposite of the public integrity concept. The paper tries to investigate if the ethical principle about bribe or, extensively, about corruption is put into practice in the same way as it is ethically perceived by the citizens of nations. After this comparison and taking into consideration the results from it, the paper reveals that the national integrity systems are key factors for the corruption phenomenon and can be real solutions for this if they are well designed and well implemented at the level of public sector.
